In this project, a performance analysis of the PostgreSQL database was conducted by comparing optimized and misconfigured configurations. The study examined how different PostgreSQL configuration settings affect the execution of parallel queries using threads, as well as their impact on system resource utilization. The experiments aimed to evaluate the efficiency of configuration parameters in supporting multi-threaded operations and ensuring optimal use of CPU and memory resources during parallel query execution.
